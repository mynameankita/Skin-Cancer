# Skin-Cancer
Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification tasks. The CNN model is trained to classify images into different categories using a dataset of skin cancer images.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-tensorflow.git
cd image-classification-tensorflow
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Organize your dataset:

Place your training images in /lakehouse/default/Files/Train directory.
Place your test images in /lakehouse/default/Files/test directory.
Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
This will train the CNN model using the provided dataset.

Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
This will evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.

Make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
This will make predictions on sample images from the test dataset and display the results.
